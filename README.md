**GOAL**:
        Creating a Geographic Information System (GIS) Analysis: A project that involves
analyzing geographic data such as maps and spatial data. You will need a
database that supports spatial data types, like PostgreSQL (PostGIS)

1. Retrieve Locations of specific features (10 marks)

2. Calculate Distance between points (10 marks)

3. Calculate Areas of Interest (specific to each group) (10 marks)

4. Analyze the queries (10 marks)

5. Sorting and Limit Executions (10 marks)

6. Optimize the queries to speed up execution time (10 marks)

7. N-Optimization of queries (5 marks)
